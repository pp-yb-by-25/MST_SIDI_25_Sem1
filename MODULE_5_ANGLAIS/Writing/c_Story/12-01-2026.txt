Several years ago, exactly 2008, I was a little child of 8 years old ,
Our country always add an hour for summer time, and for us , tradicionnal families 
we could not handle it , sometimes this clock fools us , letting us thinking is it 8:30, no it 9:30 no it s....
One day, we had school at 8:00am , Me and my brother arrived at the entrance of school we found no person there 
....what s happening why there is no one here ....
As we closer to the school halls , the teachers saw us , and said hey , what are you both doing out there ...
you are so late .. dont do that again or we will expulse you , do you understand ...
i said yeah ...and the tears going down form my face ... joining my classmates ....
it was a hard moment , knowing that i was the hardworking student there , and even so 
they treated me as a trush .... 
this life is a shit ... no one has a fucking value ...
