-------------------------------------------IMPROVED & CORRECTED ---------------------------

Several years ago, in 2008, when I was eight years old, a funny but embarrassing incident happened to me.

At that time, in my hometown, our country changed the clock for summer time. For traditional families like ours,

it was always confusing. The clock often fooled us, and we never knew whether it was 8:30 or 9:30.

One morning, my brother and I went to school at 8:00 a.m. When we arrived at the school entrance, we found no one there.

We looked at each other and wondered what was happening.

Then, as we walked closer to the school halls, some teachers saw us and shouted, “What are you doing here?” 

They told us that we were very late and warned us not to do it again.

At that moment, I felt very sad and embarrassed. Tears fell from my eyes as I joined my classmates. 

It was hard because I was a hardworking student, and I did not expect that reaction.

In the end, we discovered that the summer time change caused all the confusion. Today, when I remember that day, 

I can’t help but laugh at how a simple clock change created such a big misunderstanding.
